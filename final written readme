1. Introduction / Proposal:
I wanted to make an RPG horror game that had different levels and puzzles and different levels.I wanted to have original characters. 
I wanted the characters to be able to roam the levels freely.
It’s unique because it's original with my own character designs,it’s cute, and it's story based with many different characters.
(I added the image in issues because I cant place images on readmes)

2. Method:
Include a link to your documentation wiki
Summarize your documentation wiki if you can.
How I developed it was through the tools of painttool sai and unity. I used them because they were the most simple and easiest to use and learn from.
Google was also a bit of a big help. It helped me fix errors that enabled me to play my game.
Challenges I faced was getting my characters to move,adding new assets caused major errors, and I kept getting unfixable bugs.
Also getting the maps to show on screen and to animate them. Other major issues I was having was creating my own spritesheet,
learning how to use paint tool sai, and designing the characters to look completely original. How I overcame them was google every problem I had. I just had to work through them.
