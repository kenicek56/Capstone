1. Introduction / Proposal:
I wanted to make an RPG horror game that had different levels and puzzles and different levels.I wanted to have original characters. 
I wanted the characters to be able to roam the levels freely.
It’s unique because it's original with my own character designs,it’s cute, and it's story based with many different characters.
