1. Introduction / Proposal:
I wanted to make an RPG horror game that had different levels and puzzles and different levels.I wanted to have original characters. 
I wanted the characters to be able to roam the levels freely.
It’s unique because it's original with my own character designs,it’s cute, and it's story based with many different characters.
(I added the image in issues because I cant place images on readmes)

2. Method:
How I developed it was through the tools of painttool sai and unity. I used them because they were the most simple and easiest to use and learn from.
Google was also a bit of a big help. It helped me fix errors that enabled me to play my game.
Challenges I faced was getting my characters to move,adding new assets caused major errors, and I kept getting unfixable bugs.
Also getting the maps to show on screen and to animate them. Other major issues I was having was creating my own spritesheet,
learning how to use paint tool sai, and designing the characters to look completely original. How I overcame them was google every problem I had. I just had to work through them.
wiki link: https://github.com/kenicek56/Capstone/wiki to sum it up it just says when I completed a milestone and what each milestone was.

3. Final Product: 
What my game can do is allow my character to roam freely around the different maps and levels. The enemies work now as well. I went back and fixed the character design. My character can also die. And I added a quit menu.
In issues there is a picture of one of my completed levels. The level is animated with moving backgrounds and my player can run around it smoothly.

4. Future Work:
If I had more time I'd get through everything I didn't get to do such as adding different playable characters, dialog, jump scares, and puzzles.
I could not add these features because they were too time consuming and they never worked out how I wanted them.
